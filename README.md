# Implicit-finite-difference-method-for-solving-the-2D-heat-equation
A C++ program that solves the two-dimensional heat equation using the implicit finite-difference method. 
A partial differential equation is reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations, which can be solved, for instance, with tridiagonal matrix algorithm.
